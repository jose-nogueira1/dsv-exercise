# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Instructions for Test:

/** Instructions
   0. Fork this codesandbox and sync it with your github 
   1. import users data from data.ts
   1.1. Utilize TypeScript in your implementation
   2. On load:
   2.1. Filter the users data array to only include users where age >= 18
   2.2. Map the users data array to only include username, address, age and companyName
   2.3. Add a new ID to each user object, which should consist of a randomized sequence (6 characters) of the following: {ABCDEF123456}
   2.4. Sort the array (asc) by age, then by companyName
   2.5. Dispatch the data to the local users state
   3. Display the users' properties using a loop in the tsx, preferably in a styled "Card" form
   3.1. Add a "remove" button to each card - this should remove the user from the state
   3.2. Store the removed users in a new state instance
   3.3. Using the second input, add a method to search for a user's username with the onChange event
   3.4. The removed users should also be found if the input is being used to search for a username
   3.5. In the case where a removed user is shown during a search, there should be a "restore" button, which would insert the removed user back into the users array
   4. Extend the reducer:
   4.1. Count must always be >= 0, in all cases
   4.2. Add a case to increment count with a random number, between 1 and 10
   4.3. Add a case to increment to the nearest odd number, if already odd - increment to next odd
   4.4. Add a case to decrease the count by the input of the first textfield
   4.5. Add a case to reset the count
   4.6. Add buttons to said cases
   4.7. Add styling using MUI
   5. Provide the link to your forked repo with your answers
